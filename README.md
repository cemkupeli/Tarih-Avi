## Summary

Tarih Avı ("History Hunt" in Turkish) is an iOS history trivia application I wrote between February and August 2020. I used Swift with a Firebase backend to store questions and user information. The game has more than 500 questions across four different categories: World War I, World War II, Ottoman History, and Modern Turkish History. At its peak, Tarih Avı ranked among the top 20 trivia games on the App Store, and it remained on the leaderboard for more than a month.
